    <h1>Kharkiv</h1>
    <p>Kharkiv is the second largest city in Ukraine after the capital Kyiv. It is located in the northeastern part of
      the
      country, not far from the Russian border. Kharkiv has a rich history going back to the mid-17th century when it
      was
      founded. It rapidly grew into an important economic, industrial, cultural and educational center. Kharkiv's
      industries include machinery, electronics, food processing, and more. The city is home to many universities,
      museums, theaters and historical sites. Kharkiv suffered heavy damage during World War II but was rebuilt in the
      post-war years. Today, it continues to be an important cultural and industrial hub in Ukraine. Despite the ongoing
      conflict in eastern Ukraine, Kharkiv remains under Ukrainian control and continues to go about daily life.</p>
